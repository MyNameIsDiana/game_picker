    Ideas for project:

    When the family gets together, inevitably someone will want to ask this question:
    "Want to play a game?"
    
    But the asker knows the instant response will be this:
    "What game?"

    So we have learned to ask it this way, with no breaks between words:
    "Want-to-play-a-game-what-game?"

    We are all eager to play something but no one wants to choose the game.

    This app is for my family. It starts with a list of our favorite game and has room to add more options in the moment. Then, at the click of a button, it makes the choice for us.



    Steps:

    Display list of games
    Have spot to type in additional games
    Have way to remove games
    Button to click to spin the wheel or shuffle the cards or shake the Magic B Ball or pull name from a hat
    Display final game choice

    No need for user log-in

    Need a way to persist list of games
