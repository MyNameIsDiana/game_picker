# game_picker

When my extended family gets together, inevitably someone will want to ask:

"Want to play a game?"

But the asker knows the instant response will be:

"What game?"

So we have learned to ask it this way, with no breaks between words:

"Want-to-play-a-game-what-game?"

We are all eager to play something but no one wants to choose the game.

This app is for my family.

ISSUES:
The X in upper right corner of the modal isn't responding. Why not? Maybe something in my CSS is a conflict with Bootstrap modal.

The plus icon to the right of the "Add a game here" box isn't displaying correctly. Why does it look like a big hamburger menu?

Need to make it all look nicer. Work on that after the other issues are fixed.
