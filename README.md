# game_picker

When my extended family gets together, inevitably someone will want to ask:

"Want to play a game?"

But the asker knows the instant response will be:

"What game?"

So we have learned to ask it this way, with no breaks between words:

"Want-to-play-a-game-what-game?"

We are all eager to play something but no one wants to choose the game.

This app is for my family.
